Context: [create a basic gradio app]

My Prompt: "[Create a Gradio web app with the following features:
A file upload component that accepts CSV files
A function that uses pandas to read the CSV
Create a new 'revenue' column by multiplying 'quantity' and 'price' for each row
Calculate the total revenue by summing this new column
Display the total revenue as text output
Use gr.Interface to create the UI
The CSV will have columns: product, quantity, price"]"
