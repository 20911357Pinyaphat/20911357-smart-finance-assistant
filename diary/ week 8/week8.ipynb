        "> The chat_with_sage() function starts an interactive text-based conversation with a “Financial Sage” assistant. It greets the user and then repeatedly waits for input until the user types quit, which ends the chat. If the user types analyse, it calls a helper function analyse_transactions('transactions.csv') to summarise spending data from a CSV file and displays the results. After that, it offers a follow-up question prompt; if the user enters something, it calls get_data_advice('transactions.csv', follow_up) to give personalised insights based on the transaction data. For any other message, it assumes a normal financial question and calls get_advice(user_input) to generate general advice. After each response it prints a blank line for neat spacing, effectively creating a simple loop that handles quitting, transaction analysis, and everyday finance queries."
