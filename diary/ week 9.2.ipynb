        "- using both Gradio and custom objects solved complex problems by keeping the system modular and intuitive. Gradio components handled user interaction—collecting input and displaying results—while your custom objects managed business logic like validating transactions, tracking spending, and generating alerts. This separation made the app reliable, easy to scale, and user-friendly, with each part doing exactly what it’s best at.\n",

        "- Keeping business logic separate from interface logic made your app easier to maintain, test, and expand. The Transaction and Manager classes handle data and rules, while Gradio handles user interaction. This separation means you can change how the app looks or behaves without touching the core logic—and vice versa. It also makes debugging simpler and future features (like reports or alerts) easier to add.\n",

For example, it suggested separating alert logic into a method inside TransactionManager, using emoji reactions for spending feedback, and connecting business rules to Gradio components in a clean, scalable way. It also helped you think in terms of modular design—like adding budgets or sparkle scores as new classes—so your app stays organized as it grows. You didn’t just get answers; you got a creative partner that pushed your ideas further.\n",

Instead of solving everything alone, you now co-create—testing ideas, refining logic, and iterating designs with instant feedback. It helped you think modularly, separate concerns cleanly, and add features like alerts or sparkle scores with confidence.
